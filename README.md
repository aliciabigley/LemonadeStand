User stories:

cast for a day or week and then what the actual weather is on the given day.
(10 points): As a player, the price of product should affect demand, so that if the price is too high, sales will decrease, or if the price is too low, sales will increase, etc. 
(10 points): As a player, I want each customer to be a separate object with its own chance of buying a glass of lemonade, so that how much lemonade is purchased and how much a customer is willing to pay will vary from customer to customer.
(5 points): As a player, I want the ability to make a recipe for my lemonade, so that I can include x-amount of lemons, x-amount of sugar, and x-amount of ice.

(10 points (5 points each)): As a developer, I want to pinpoint at least two places where I used one of the SOLID design principles and discuss my reasoning, so that I can properly understand good code design. Minimum of two SOLID design principles must be used. 
Bonus Points:
(5 points): As a player, I want there to be persistent data (file reading/writing) to keep track of game data, so that I can have my total profit or loss stored as a save or load game. 
(5 points): As a player, I want the game to be playable for more than one player, so that I can have multiple humans play each other or a human play a computer.
